Motivation for this repository is to use interactive notebooks and relatively simple programs to understand common concepts in these domains.

## Usage

If you have ![pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi) installed, then just run `pixi run lab` to launch JupyterLab with correct environment setup.

Then you can open and explore the notebook for any topic.
